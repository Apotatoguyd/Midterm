// I used the the game Excitebike to demonstrate my midterm.
//The base game will only contain the basic moving and boosting with D being move the bike and a being apply the boost until duraction is gone.
//The map is just a couple jumps with only one lane due to my limited programing skills and my decision to use most of my time to the shaders.
// Took the toons shader and slapped on the hologram to make it popout more. It works because the toons only affect the Albedo.
// so I can add the hologram due to it being the emission. I did this because toon shader without it would just blend in with the skybox so the hologram will make it pop.
//The Color correction plan initially was to color correct te skybox to make it a desert colored skybox because the sky box would also have effect on the reflection that it caused and in the game the sky box is the only desert part that I presumably see.
//For the holograms I added a texture because it would easily fit the game due to it's ability to contrast the colors of the ground and it can easily help the player tell apart lanes.
